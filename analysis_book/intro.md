# Introduction

On this page, you will find a data analysis for **COVID-19**. We decided to divide each section by steps and level of analysis detail with a **top-down** approach.

The objectives of each chapter are described below.

- [Before to start](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/covid_analysis/01-before-to-start.html): This chapter will discuss how to download this project and get it up and running on your computer using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
- [Collect data](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/covid_analysis/02-collect-data.html): This chapter will discuss what data you will use and how to download it and give notes on the status of the data.
- [Process raw data](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/covid_analysis/03-process-raw-data.html): In the previous chapter, you downloaded all the data in its raw format without modifying anything. In this chapter, we will work on processing the data to bring it to a clean layout that is easy to analyze.
- [Global time series analysis](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/covid_analysis/04-global-time-series.html): In this chapter, we will take the time series of confirmed cases and deaths to describe the behavior of the pandemic and make death forecasting.
- [Country level analysis](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/covid_analysis/05-country-level-analysis.html): In the previous chapter, you learned how to describe the behavior of the pandemic on a global level. In this chapter, you will visualize how the covid-19 spread between each country, which are currently the most affected countries, and how, in the end, we are all in this together.
- [Mexico analysis](https://jvelezmagic.github.io/covid_analysis/06-mexico-analysis.html): In this chapter, you will analyze the behavior of the pandemic in Mexico, one of the countries with the highest mortality rate (at least as of September 22, 2021).
